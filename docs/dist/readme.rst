QuickLook ReST with Nimrod quick readme
=======================================

Thank you for trying `QuickLook render plugin for ReST
<https://github.com/gradha/quicklook-rest-with-nimrod>`_!

To install the plugin, drag the ``QuickLook reStructuredText.qlgenerator``
bundle to your ``~/Library/QuickLook/`` directory. If you are updating a
previous version you might need to run ``qlmanage -r`` from a Terminal to purge
Quick Look cache.

If something doesn't work, you can drop me a note at
https://github.com/gradha/quicklook-rest-with-nimrod/issues. Good luck!
