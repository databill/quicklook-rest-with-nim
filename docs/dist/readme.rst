QuickLook ReST with Nim quick readme
====================================

Thank you for trying `QuickLook reST with Nim
<https://github.com/gradha/quicklook-rest-with-nim>`_!

If you are using OSX 10.10 Yosemite, to install the plugin drag the ``QuickLook
reStructuredText.qlgenerator`` bundle to the ``/Library/QuickLook/`` directory.
**Note** that the first character of that path is a **slash**, you have to
install the bundle at the system level or it won't work.  For OSX 10.9
Mavericks and earlier the bundle will also work installed in your
``~/Library/QuickLook/`` directory.  Whenever a workaround is found for
Yosemite not working from the home directory install a new version will be
released.

Once the plugin is installed, or after updating it, you need to run the command
``qlmanage -r`` from a Terminal to purge the QuickLook cache. After doing that
you you should be able to preview the included ``example.rst`` file.

If something doesn't work, you can drop me a note at
https://github.com/gradha/quicklook-rest-with-nim/issues. Good luck!
