Gradha's rst hacks
==================

This directory contains a copy of Nimrod's standard library rst modules. The
copy is meant for experimental hacking and compilation against the last
standard Nimrod compiler 0.9.4. Presumably stuff will be migrated to Nimrod's
development branch if changes get approved.
